/* Thrift Battleship
 * Puzzle Master (1051962371@facebook.com)
 * This file describes the game interface for your Battleship client to interact
 * with the Battleship server.  Compile this file using the Thrift compiler to
 * generate skeleton code or stubs in the language(s) of your choice.
 * The rules of the Battleship are simple and are explained in the problem
 * statement on the Puzzles page.  In terms of running a client to successfully
 * play the game, your code should loosely follow this pseudocode:
 * registerClient()
 * for each ship
 *   placePiece(ship, some_location, some_orientation)
 * while game not over
 *   isMyTurn()
 *   attack(some_location)
 * If you are interested in the moves being made by the opponent, you can also
 * call getOpponentsLastAttack() after each of their turns.
 * Once the game is over (ie. some player's ships have all been sunk), the
 * will throw GameOverExceptions on calls to functions involving the completed
 * game.  Check below for specific documentation of the
 * available calls your client may make to the server.

 * All references to specific ships are made by integer ID as specified
 * by this enumeration.  This is used on calls to placePiece().

 * HIT implies a hit on a ship in a location that hasn't been hit before,

 * Miss implies a total miss (including attacking a point outside the 10x10
 *  board, or an attack on a point that has already been hit.
 * A ship name (the id's correspond to the ids in the Ship enum) implies that
 * your attack sunk the indicated ship.
 * NOT_YOUR_TURN means you tried to make an attack out of turn.  Cut that out.
